# Craftbot-Prusaslicer

Still in alpha; trying to catch any bugs especially with Prusa 5
have done some successful prints


Copy the files/folders to C:\Program Files\Prusa3D\PrusaSlicer\resources\profiles

then open prusa slicer to install printers;

there are seperate printers for each mode;


If previous version installed; may need to deleted old printer then reintall printer under 'Configuration Wizard' in prusaslicer

To check if you have the latest version check start gcode under printer setting




Latest Version 0.02

thanks
