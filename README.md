# Craftbot-Prusaslicer

Still in alpha; trying to catch any bugs especially with Prusa 5
have done some successful prints


Copy the files/folders to C:\Program Files\Prusa3D\PrusaSlicer\resources\profiles

then open prusa slicer to install printers;

there are seperate printers for each mode;

thanks
